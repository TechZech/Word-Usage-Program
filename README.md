# Word-Usage-Program
C++ Program that utilizes hash tables to collect the statistics of word, number, and character usage in a file (redirected as the standard input)

Specifically, the program takes a file as input and keeps track of how many times each word, number, and letter was used, and at the end it gives the top 10 most common words, numbers, and letters from the file

Whole program is written in **driver6.cpp** and the test files are sample files that can be used as input to test the program

All work was written by Benjamin Zech. *Do not steal or plagerize*
